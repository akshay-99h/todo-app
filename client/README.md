# TodoList Frontend

This is the frontend part of the TodoList application. It's built using React and is designed to interact with the corresponding backend API.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following tools installed on your system to run the frontend:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Git (optional but recommended for version control)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git (or download the ZIP archive):

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd todo-frontend
   ```
3. Install the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```
This will launch the application in your default web browser. The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

## Building for Production

To build the app for production, run:

    npm run build

This will create an optimized production build in the build directory.

## Configuration

You might need to configure environment variables or settings for API endpoints. Edit the `.env` file to provide necessary configurations.
